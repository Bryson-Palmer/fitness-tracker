  Fitness Tracker will help you analyze and view your last 7 workouts. You can create a new workout or you can continue your previous workout. The landing page displays your most recent workout and some stats (Date, Total Workout Duration, Exercises Performed, All Weights Combined, Total Sets/Reps/Distance, and Total Weight Lifted). The workout dashboard displays four different types of graphs each with different information (Total Time Per Workout, Total Weight Lifted Per Workout, Duration Per Exercise, and Weight Lifted Per Exercise). It's an easy app to use and to help you keep track of seven recent workouts.

## üîß <a id='installation'></a> Installation Instructions
* Go to https://my-fitness-chart.herokuapp.com and you can start using the app right away.


## üíº  <a id='usage'></a> Usage Information
Simply start a new workout.
* Select a workout type (resistance or cardio)
* Add the information necessary and select add workout or complete.
* After a few workouts, check your workout dashboard and see your progress.
* Feel good about what you've accomplished and keep at it.



## üîç <a id='future-development'></a> Future Development
This is a neat little application though it has a lot of room for imporvement.
* I would add another html route that would show a list of the seven wokouts and allow a user to update/delete any of them.
* I would spend more time stlying the app and get away from the facebook motif.
* It would be nice to get the last 7 days of workouts and make it more date oriented.
* It would be nice to also create another model called workout name and associate it to all the workouts one puts together. That way a user could create a workout called upper body, lower body, or BJJ warm ups. Really allowing the user to customize the organization of the workouts.
